# Mention @user for Wordpress wpDiscuz

An autocomplete for textarea comments (works for wpDiscuz ONLY). Type '@' and then start typing out a users name. 
The autocompelete will help you to find the user you are looking for. This works for wpDiscuz. 
It can be modified to work for the default comments by replacing '.wc_comment' with '#comment' in the keyup event listener.
